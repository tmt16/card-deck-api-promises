# card-deck-api-promises

Asynchronous Code in JavaScript
Let’s have some fun working with callbacks and promises! You’ll complete these exercises twice, using two different methods. First, you’ll use promises! Then, in the exercises at the end of the next subunit, you’ll use async / await!

If this is your first time seeing these challenges, start by solving them with promises.

Once you’ve solved this using promises continue to the next subunit and after learning about async functions solve these using async and await.

Part 2: Deck of Cards
Make a request to the Deck of Cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, console.log the value and the suit (e.g. “5 of spades”, “queen of diamonds”).

Make a request to the deck of cards API to request a single card from a newly shuffled deck. Once you have the card, make a request to the same API to get one more card from the same deck.

Once you have both cards, console.log the values and suits of both cards.

Build an HTML page that lets you draw cards from a deck. When the page loads, go to the Deck of Cards API to create a new deck, and show a button on the page that will let you draw a card. Every time you click the button, display a new card, until there are no cards left in the deck.
